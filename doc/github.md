How to use GitHub
======

## Installation:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and set up an account.
2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
3. In the GitHub Desktop application, click File -> Clone Repository.
4. Click DDriggs00/383-Group-5, select a path, and click clone.

## Downloading changes (Pulling)

Before you make any changes, always click "Fetch Origin", and if the button changes to "Pull Origin", click it a second time.  Fetching Origin is contacting the GitHub repository to see if there are any changes since the last time you synced your work.  If the button changes to "Pull Origin", that means it found some changes and needs to sync them with your local copy (called pulling)

## Uploading Edits (Committing and Pushing)

1. Make changes to the files in the synced directories.
2. Open GitHub Desktop and go to the changes tab (on the far left)
3. There will be a list of all the changes that have been made to files in the directory.
4. If there are any files you do not want to upload the changes from, right click and click ignore
5. Add a (very) short summary and an optional description.
6. Click "Commit to Master"
7. Click "Push Origin"

## Reverting Edits

* If you have not pushed yet
    * Right-Click the file in Github Desktop andd click "Discard Changes"
* If changes are already pushed
    1. Go the the GitHub Desktop History tab
    2. Right-Click the commit that you want to revert
    3. Click "Revert this Commit"
